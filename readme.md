# GALACTIC CONQUESTS README

ABOUT
---------------------------------
During my third year at St Andrews University, I took a module in Video Game Development. My oringal aim was to continue developing "Galatic Conquests" and eventually publish it, however, due to limited ability to publish processing (java applets) I have decided to make the game open source. Built using the processsing platform, I've adapted it to run in a more java-style project setup. The game is in a playable state, however, it still needs a little work to make it truly awesome! 

Hope you enjoy playing it. Pull Requests welcome :D
