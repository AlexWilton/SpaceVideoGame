# GALACTIC CONQUESTS README

ABOUT
---------------------------------
During my fourth year at St Andrews University, I took a module in Video Game Development. My original aim was to continue developing "Galactic Conquests" and eventually publish it, however, due to limited ability to publish processing (java applets) I have decided to make the game open source. Built using the processsing platform, I've adapted it to run in a more java-style project setup. The game is in a playable state, however, it still needs a little work to make it truly awesome! 

Hope you enjoy playing it. Pull Requests welcome :D


RUN
---------------------------------
To run the game, simply launch the executable jar file SpaceVideoGame.jar.
This is a self-contained jar which contains copies of all the needed libraries and resources to play the game.
